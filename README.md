## Game Rules

Players take turns dropping one of their colored discs from the top into a column of a 7x6 grid.
The disc falls straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column.
The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.
If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, the game is declared a draw.
